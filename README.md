This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

Steps:
1. Install create-react-app globally
`npm install -g create-react-app`

2. Install create-react-app into the child folder of your current position in terminal named "tic-tac-toe" and pass into it
`create-react-app tic-tac-toe`
`cd tic-tac-toe/`

3. Copy all files form [my repo](https://github.com/cotang/tic-tac-toe-react) to the folder "tic-tac-toe" with rewriting

4. Run npm. The project will open on http://localhost:3000
`npm start`
